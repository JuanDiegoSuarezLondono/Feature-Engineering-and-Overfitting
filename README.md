# Feature Engineering and Overfitting

Welcome to the Feature Engineering and Overfitting repository! This repository covers essential concepts and techniques in feature engineering and dealing with overfitting in machine learning models.

## Overview: Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is a crucial aspect of building effective machine learning models. In this section, we dive into various techniques to enhance the predictive power of your models through feature manipulation.

## Overview: Overfitting

Overfitting is a common challenge in machine learning, where models capture noise in the training data instead of underlying patterns. In this section, we explore techniques to identify and mitigate overfitting in your models.

## Mini-Lesson 8.2: Rules of Training, Validation, and Test Sets

Understand the importance of proper data splitting for training, validation, and testing your models. By following best practices in data partitioning, you'll ensure robust model evaluation and avoid common pitfalls in machine learning experimentation.

Get ready to master the art of feature engineering and tackle the challenges of overfitting in machine learning models! Each section offers practical insights and hands-on activities to deepen your understanding and enhance your skills. Let's embark on this journey together and build more robust and effective machine learning models!
